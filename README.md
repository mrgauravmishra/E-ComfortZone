# E-ComfortZone
 **E-comfort zone **  
 INTRODUCTION : Its an e-learning android application which i developed during my last semester for the capstone project. 
 It is  an free of cost e-learning app. The main idea to create this application was to provide students of my university 
 a platform for peer to peer learning and an option for the students to learn from a teacher who teaches in another class.
 It have two modules.  
 * Server app 
 * Students app  
 Server portal: Verified Teachers  or student will create videos of curriculum and upload it on provided platform (YouTube)
 in unpublished mode, by the server app module so that it could only be viewed on the app. 
 Student Portal: Students can access the video content here and learn. Apart from videos some study materials are also provided.
 Apart from that if a student have any doubts, they can put their questions on the Discussion forum inbuilt in the app.  
 
 WORKING  
 Student and tutors have to signup first on app using their Phone No, Name, Password. After that sign in, and you will be able to
 access the content. Admin can give right to create a course to verified people. 
 1. Sign Up,  
 2. Sign In, 
 3. Select respective Branch, 
 4. Select the course respective to that branch. 
 5. Select the Unit of that course which you want to study.
 6. Its a complete app so I included the functionality of changing the password and forgot password, logout, save password options as well.
 7. A discussion forum is inbuilt in the app in case any student have any doubts they can put it there. And the users and tuters can answer that. 
 8. Course can also be shared on Facebook.   
 
 DEVELOPMENT 
 * Its an android and java programming based application. 
 * Google FireBase Database is used for storing the the students and tuters login data, and all other course materials and pictures are 
 also stored on firebase. 
 * Basically nothing is stored inside of app. Everything is fetched directly from the FireBase Database. 
 * It helps reduce the size of app drastically. And as app is only using internet services, RAM uses is also very Low.  
 
 App Size: 5 MB only.  
 
 Future:  
 * Addition of courses.  
 * Addition of exam/test module.  
 * Addition of modules which will help students in daily life apart from curriculum.  
 * minor bug fixex.  
 *  UI Modifications.  
 *  Phone based authentication.  
 * Addition of competitive courses.  
 *  New additional functionality as required.   
 
 Note:
 * App is not on Playstore yet. It will be uploaded soon. For preview or other queries of applications contact on given Email or 
 phone No.  
 * App was solely developed by me, no other persons was part of this project.
